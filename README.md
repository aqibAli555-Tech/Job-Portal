# 🚀 Job Portal

**Job Portal** is a complete **job marketplace platform** that connects **job seekers**, **employers**, **affiliates**, and **admins**.  
It’s designed to simplify the hiring process by offering tools for posting jobs, applying online, CV management, staff management, affiliate commissions, and advanced analytics.  

Unlike traditional job boards, Job Portal focuses on **speed, engagement, and accessibility** — providing real-time communication between candidates and companies, along with powerful admin and affiliate tools.
